description = http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/dungeon-sprint-fast-and-furious\n\nDungeon Sprint is a twist on Dungeon Crawl: only one dungeon level is generated, but it's...\n\nA mostly-fixed (i.e., mostly non-random), very difficult level; the player gains experience and trains skills at 27 times the normal rate, and gains piety at 9 times the normal rate. Some problematic features in Crawl such as certain teleportation effects are disabled in Sprint.
